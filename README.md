A branch of the original QML code (https://www.qmlcode.org) containing implementation of FJK (along with some other experimental code) used in DOI:10.1063/5.0083301. See tests/omlqml_test.yml for a Conda environment where the results could be reproduced.

Installation is analogous to the one of QML code: https://www.qmlcode.org/installation.html

A more convenient implementation of the same procedures can be found at: https://github.com/chemspacelab/qml2
